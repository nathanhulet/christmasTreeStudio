This is a Christmas tree designer studio. 
This project is a four-tier MVC web application using html, CSS, Bootstrap, 
JavaScript, php, and MySQL. Our database will contain a table for each tree that 
you save to it Our system includes special 
features like designing a custom tree, saving designs to the database, loading 
designs from the database, and viewing a gallery of all the trees that have been created. 
The business logic of our 
web application allows any user to create a new table in the database for their 
design, as well as read the data from other tables to view the trees. Users can 
update their own designs, and only an administrator can remove designs from the database.</p>
