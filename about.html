<p> style="margin-top: 5.5em;padding: 0 7em 2em 0;"> For our term project, we are creating a 
  Christmas tree designer studio. This project will be a four-tier MVC web application using html, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, php, and MySQL. Our database 
  will contain a table for each tree that gets saved to it, and each table will contain integer variables signifying the decoration options for each 
  location on the tree. Our system includes special features like designing a custom tree, saving designs to the database, loading designs from the 
  database, viewing a gallery of all the trees that have been created, and a system to like trees in the gallery. Our web application will also 
  include sound effects and Christmas themed background music.  The business logic of our web application allows any user to create a new table 
  in the database for their design, as well as read the data from other tables to view the trees. Users can update their own designs, and only 
  an administrator can remove designs from the database.
